# Edge Map Extraction of High Resolution Facial Images

A computer vision project implementing an advanced edge detection algorithm specifically designed for high-resolution facial images, combining directional gradients, weak/strong edge detection, and Zhang-Suen thinning for optimal facial contour extraction.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of extracting precise edge maps from high-resolution facial images while maintaining a balance between preserving fine details and highlighting facial contours. The algorithm outperforms traditional methods like Canny and HED by effectively capturing both low-level and high-level facial features.

## Algorithm Pipeline

The edge detection process follows a six-step methodology:

1. **Gaussian Smoothing** - Noise reduction using optimal œÉ value (œÉ=2)
2. **Directional Gradients** - Horizontal and vertical gradient computation
3. **Weak Edge Detection** - Curved boundary detection with adaptive thresholding
4. **Strong Edge Detection** - Composite gradient variation analysis
5. **Edge Merging** - Combining weak and strong edge maps
6. **Zhang-Suen Thinning** - Skeletal edge refinement

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Optimization**: Specifically designed for facial images with exceptional resolution
- **Dual-Threshold Detection**: Separate handling of weak and strong edges for comprehensive coverage
- **Adaptive Smoothing**: Optimal œÉ parameter selection for noise reduction without detail loss
- **Facial-Specific Design**: Tailored for facial features like eyes, nose, mouth, and overall face contour
- **Balanced Detail Preservation**: Maintains fine details while avoiding excessive low-level noise
- **Comparative Performance**: Superior results compared to Canny and HED algorithms

## Performance Evaluation

### Dataset Testing
- **Primary Dataset**: ~10,000 high-resolution facial images (1024√ó1024)
- **Secondary Dataset**: Mixed resolution images for adaptability validation
